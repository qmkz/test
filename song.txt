What?

Pre chorus (Kanye West)

we off the grid, grid, grid
this for my kid, kid, kid
for when my kid, kid, kids have kids
everything we did for the crib
everything we did, how we live
all this smoke got a scent
all that smoke kept a scent
everything i spoke, what i meant
never disguise my intent
lines outside the event
brought my life out the trench
god, thank God
look what He did, did, did, did, did, did
we off the grid, grid, grid, grid, grid
what?
we off the grid, grid, grid, grid

Verse (Playboi Carti)

i'm off the grid (homicide, homicide, what?)
got tats on my ribs (ah), tattoos on my ribs (what?)
i just tatted my kid, Onyx (slatt)
i just threw twenty K on these-, we was at Onyx (ah, what?)
i just bought me some brand new clothes, Dover Street Market (Givenchy)
ayy, we just took the route to Charlotte (ayy, ah)
i'm in the Rolls-Royce f- on what you call it? (Yeah, yeah)
i light a opp blunt and let your b- try it (ah)
uh, them off the grid, i'm on a f- diet (what?)

Chorus (Kanye West)

we off the grid, grid, grid
this for my kid, kid, kid, kid
everything we did for the crib did here
flexin' with the business trip
going cray, take some G6
lit lit, '76
he split this
we off the grid, grid, grid

Verse (Fivio Foreign)

yeah, look, when i was in jail, i was lowkey (uh)
shoutout the supporters that wrote me
eat food, work out and then go sleep
you know i'm prayin', he carryin' both feet (yeah)
know we got God with us (got God with us)
you look at me and see a God figure (uh)
and when i start vibin', i know that He with me
and i'ma always catch a hard shiver (uh)
i know it's demons in that dark liquor (uh)
we buy a bottle and squash with ya (uh)
everybody turn into a harsh n-
but my pockets bigger and my heart richer (uh)
my mind smarter, my grind harder (skrr)
and my car quicker (skrrt)
i met her in church, she pray for me
she my God-sister (God-sister), yeah
i'm only trustin' the people i keep close
n- sellin' they soul for a repost
remember when i was broke, wearin' cheap coats
now it's diamonds and houses and C notes (uh)
i'm feelin' marvelous (i'm feelin' marvelous)
who let the monster loose? (Who let the monster loose?)
they call me a product of my environment (uh)
i tell them "nah, i'm what god-produced" (baow)
defense good, and them guards can shoot (baow)
i put 'em on you, it get hard to move
tattoo on my face is the mark of truth
gotta watch what you say when they market you (huh)
i already predicted this (i already predicted this)
y'all only witnessed it (y'all only witnessed it)
look, got a couple old friends that i'm not really clickin' with
i know they pray that we settle our differences
i pray that they lower all my n- sentences
i got some demons i'm not even dealin' with
they in they feelings, i'm not really feelin' it
and i know some members that gave back they membership
you switched up, huh, like how you not feelin' me?
look, i act like i care, but i don't really care
now i live in a new buildin' with amenities
i got a new ceilin' with a chimney
i got a few n- wanna finish me
i don't get too friendly with the enemy
you gotta move different, when you in the industry, woo, yeah
you gotta move different, when you in the industry, ha
you gotta move different, when you in the, look
god blessed me with amazing grace (uh)
she fell in love with my day-to-day (uh)
i just want my problems to fade away (uh)
man, i'm tired of n-, i need gatorade
boy, i got on my feet and i made a name
and i made it a necklace, huh
when you from the bottom and you work your hardest
to get the top, then they gotta respect it
if you got a voice, then you gotta project it
if you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it
if you got a name, you gotta protect it
if you give me shock, then you gotta electric
tryna live a new life, so i got a new plan
that i gotta finesse with (look, yeah)
cause they want me to lose, that ain't part of the rules
i be tryin' so hard not to move reckless

Chorus (Kanye West)

we off the grid, grid, grid
this for my kid, kid, kid, kid
everything we did for the crib did here
flexin' with the business trip
going cray, take some G6
lit lit, '76
he split lids, then ask for shade, tsk-tsk-tsk
take this trip, trip, trip, this, this
this, this, this, this
you all still lit, lit, lit
i'm off the grid, grid, grid, grid
off the grid, grid, grid, grid

Verse (Kanye West)

first it go viral, then they get digital
then they get critical, no, i'm not doin' no interview
mask on my face, you can't see what i'm finna do
had to move away from people that's miserable
don't wanna link you, i ain't finna sit with you
ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
don't get me mad just 'cause i don't wanna injure you
she put my paintings inside of her living room
look at the problems and issues i'm livin' through
they tryna drown me, i rise to my pinnacle
walked through the block like the neighborhood general
drop me the low and then that's where i'll send it to
i was forgettin' you, now i remember, now i remember
did what i want, and i say what i want
and i thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
i got this God power, that's my leverages
i got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
i gotta help myself out of selfishness
i just bought a floor out of selfridges
i gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
i gotta tell 'em sorry, they too delicate
i gotta stay with God where the blessings is
i ain't deliverin' heavenly messages just for the hell of it
don't try to test me
i keep it clean, but it could get messy
i talk to God every day, that's my bestie
they playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
and this money could never neglect me
i pray that my family, they never resent me
and she fell in love with me soon she met me
we both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
we had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
you not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
he wait 'til i fall and then pull up and catch me
your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
nah, nah, i get 'em fast, see
you feel a way, then come pull up and get me
might do somethin' wild if i feel like you press me
nah, i get 'em fast, see
you feel a way, then come pull up and get me
might do somethin' wild if i feel like you press me

Chorus (Kanye West)

we off the grid, grid, grid
this for my kid, kid, kid
for when my kid, kid, kids have kids
everything we did for the crib
pray for what folks and them did
only thing we pray god forgive-give-give
may god forbid-bid-bid
they hit one of the kid, kid, kids
took off his list, list, list
look what they did, did, did
pray for the crib, crib, crib

Outro (Kanye West)

some say a-a-adam could never be bla-a-ack
cause a black man'll never share his rib, rib, rib, rib, rib, rib
